# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat --help
yarn hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true yarn hardhat test
yarn hardhat node
yarn hardhat compile
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
yarn hardhat coverage
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
yarn hardhat block-number --network goerli
```
